                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I was born in <span class="highlight springfield">Springfield</span>, Massachusetts, in 2003. I attended Renaissance Springfield Magnet School from age 12 until 14, where I then transferred to Pope Francis Preparatory School and graduated at 17. I’ve grown up playing sports, including soccer, football, and basketball, which have taught me teamwork and perseverance. I’m excited to work this job, eager to bring my positive attitude and strong work ethic to the team. I look forward to getting to know my coworkers, starting each day with optimism, and contributing to a great work environment.</p>
